# Kautext UN Banner

To include the banner on any part of the website, use the content inside the body tag of the index.html file and upload the assets folder.


Probably, the relative path of the assets directory needs to be adapted. I recommend using find and replace to adapt all /assets/ usages of the template.

Shadow host is used to prevent conflicts with the outer website.
